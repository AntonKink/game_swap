Just a simple game called "Lights Out"

How to solve, explanation https://mathworld.wolfram.com/LightsOutPuzzle.html

The goal is fo fill all the cells with red color.

What is done:
1) cells (buttons). Int he setings menu you can choose field size: 2x2, 3x3, 3x4, 5x5 or whatever you want.
2) 4 different game rules: 
   • 2 stages, 
   • 2 stages, but some "lights" randomly generates,
   • 3 stages, 
   • 3 stages, but some "lights" randomly generates.
3) to win fill all the "lights" with red.
4) when you click on one cell, cell swaps its color and 4 cells around change color too.
5) exeptions: cells in the corners swaps around 2 cells, cells on the side of the field swaps around 3 cells.
6) reset button. You can always start again with the same generated field.
7) random. You can always start again with new generated field. 
8) min field size is 1x1. max 99x99. So, textbars a bit limited, so there must be always be one digit,and no more than 2 digits.
